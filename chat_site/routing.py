"""
This root routing configuration specifies that when a connection is made to the Channels development server,
the ProtocolTypeRouter will first inspect the type of connection. If it is a WebSocket connection (ws:// or wss://),
the connection will be given to the AuthMiddlewareStack.

The AuthMiddlewareStack will populate the connection’s scope with a reference to the currently authenticated user,
similar to how Django’s AuthenticationMiddleware populates the request object of a view function with the currently 
authenticated user. (Scopes will be discussed later in this tutorial.) Then the connection will be given to the
URLRouter.

The URLRouter will examine the HTTP path of the connection to route it to a particular consumer, based on the provided
url patterns.
